# Hi there, I'm Andy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) passionate about learning new technologies and turning ideas into projects that can make a difference.

For me, programming is all about building and creating projects that help others. I want to design solutions that have real-world impacts.

In my free time, I enjoy playing **badminton**, **tennis**, and **poker**, as well as **building computers**.

If youâ€™re working on something exciting or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!
